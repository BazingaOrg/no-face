# No Face - Development Roadmap

Privacy-first face masking tool - Replace faces with emojis, all processing done locally in your browser.

## ✅ Completed Features (MVP - Phase 1)

- [x] Project initialization (Next.js 15 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS v4)
- [x] Image upload (drag & drop + click + mobile camera)
- [x] Face detection (face-api.js with SSD MobileNet V1 + Tiny Face Detector)
- [x] Canvas display with face overlay and interactive face boxes
- [x] Emoji picker integration (emoji-picker-react) with Chinese keyword search
- [x] Click-to-replace workflow
- [x] Export original quality image (PNG format)
- [x] Mobile responsive design (Duolingo-inspired UI)
- [x] Advanced settings panel
  - [x] Detection sensitivity slider
  - [x] Detector type selection (SSD vs Tiny)
  - [x] Emoji size/scale adjustment
  - [x] Emoji opacity control
  - [x] Position offset controls (X/Y)
- [x] Animations and transitions (Framer Motion)
- [x] "Apply to All" and "Reset" buttons
- [x] Random emoji button
- [x] Fallback to native emoji rendering when CDN fails

## 🚧 Technical Debt & Known Issues

### High Priority

- [x] **Model files hosting**: Models can be self-hosted or loaded from CDN
  - **Status**: Using local `/models` with CDN fallback
  - **Setup guide**: See `MODELS_DOWNLOAD.md` for instructions
  - **Configuration**: `lib/faceApi.ts` line 29 switches between local/CDN

- [ ] **Large image optimization**: Images > 10MB may cause performance issues
  - **Consider**: Web Worker for face detection (non-blocking UI)
  - **Consider**: Progressive loading indicator
  - **Consider**: Auto-compress input to max 1920px width for processing

### Medium Priority

- [ ] **Emoji loading optimization**: emoji-picker-react loads ~3600 emojis
  - **Consider**: Virtual scrolling implementation
  - **Consider**: Lazy loading by category
  - **Consider**: Preload popular emojis only

- [ ] **Browser compatibility testing**
  - [ ] Safari (especially iOS Safari)
  - [ ] Chrome/Edge (Chromium-based)
  - [ ] Firefox
  - [ ] Mobile browsers

### Low Priority

- [ ] **Performance monitoring**: Add metrics for face detection time
- [ ] **Error boundary**: Graceful error handling for unsupported browsers
- [ ] **Accessibility**: Keyboard navigation, ARIA labels, screen reader support
- [x] **Console cleanup**: Remove debug console statements from production code

## 📊 Performance Optimization Ideas

- [ ] Implement Web Worker for face detection
  - [ ] Offload heavy computation from main thread
  - [ ] Keep UI responsive during processing
- [ ] Use OffscreenCanvas for image processing
  - [ ] Background rendering for better performance
- [ ] Add image compression before processing
  - [ ] Limit input size to 1920px width
  - [ ] Maintain aspect ratio
  - [ ] But export original quality
- [ ] Cache detection results
  - [x] Store face coordinates in state
  - [x] Re-use when changing emoji settings (auto re-apply)
  - [ ] Persist to localStorage for session recovery
- [ ] Lazy load twemoji assets
  - [ ] Load only visible emojis in picker
  - [x] Preload selected emoji with fallback
